      <description>I’ve been thinking about a concept that I’ve been calling “Proof of Thought” for a while now. It’s the idea that certain processes in the modern workplace require that someone thinks about them for a while, and the best way to prove that they have done so historically is through written reports. You know the type: project plans, strategy documents, self-evaluations. The kind of documents that no one will ever read in their entirety after they’ve been written, but that still need to be well-written, relevant, and include enough plain English to make sense.</description>

      <description>Or: Why is this software engineer being so difficult? So you&amp;rsquo;ve got some data. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping track of how successful my taco truck has been.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing crazy here: a date column, how many of each kind of taco I sold, and where I parked my taco truck that day. At this point, I&amp;rsquo;d like to create some sweet visualizations of my data, to better understand the fundamentals of my taco truck business.</description>
