      <description>I’ve been thinking about a concept that I’ve been calling “Proof of Thought” for a while now. It’s the idea that certain processes in the modern workplace require that someone thinks about them for a while, and the best way to prove that they have done so historically is through written reports. You know the type: project plans, strategy documents, self-evaluations. The kind of documents that no one will ever read in their entirety after they’ve been written, but that still need to be well-written, relevant, and include enough plain English to make sense.</description>
