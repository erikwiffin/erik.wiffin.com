I provide AI strategy and implementation services. If you think I can help you, contact me at [erik.wiffin@gmail.com](erik.wiffin@gmail.com).

## Services

* **AI Strategy:** I will work with you to help you define your company's AI Strategy. 
* **Zero to One: Proof of Concept Implementation:** I will develop a proof of concept to validate a product idea or lay a foundation for your existing engineering team.
* **One to One Million: AI in production:** I will provision the infrastructure required for you to run your AI in production, covering everything from hardware requirements, to logging and monitoring to prevent "model drift" over time.

## Background

I've been working with language models since before they were large. In addition to over 15 years in the technology industry working mostly in product engineering, I have been experimenting with LLMs since the first ChatGPT and have an understanding of the space that I will use to ensure your project's success.
