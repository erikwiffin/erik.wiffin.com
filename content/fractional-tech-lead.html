          Maybe your MVP is buckling under real traffic, you're preparing for
          your next fundraise, or you're a non-technical founder who knows it's
          time to get serious about your technology.

    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="text-lg">
          I'm Erik Wiffin, and I've spent the last 15+ years helping startups
          and scale-ups navigate the messy reality of building software that
          actually works. I've been the founding engineer who turned an idea
          into a product, the director who scaled engineering teams from 5 to
          20+, and the leader who kept the lights on during pivots, fundraises,
          and organizational resets.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-4">
          I've seen what happens when technical debt catches up with growth, and
          I know how to fix it without burning everything down. Now I'm helping
          early-stage companies get their tech house in orderâ€”whether that's
          stabilizing a buckling MVP, building out a hiring process, or just
          being the experienced voice in the room when technical decisions need
          to be made.
